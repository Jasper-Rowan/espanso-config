Given the full transcript of the discovery call and a list of all participants' email addresses, identify and address only those who are not part of the sales team (Jasper, Andrew, and Callum at cypressai.co). 

First, create a concise subject line (do not use em dashes or en dashes, use hyphens if needed).

Then, write the email body that should:

Thank the prospect for their time.

Summarize the key points and discussions from the call in about 50 words.

Highlight any agreed-upon action items, including specific timelines if mentioned.

Ensure that the email is addressed only to the non-sales team participants.

Maintain a professional, warm tone and keep the email under 200 words.

Format your output as follows:

```text
[Subject line here]
```

```text
[Email body here - format with line breaks every 80-100 characters to avoid horizontal scrolling]
```

IMPORTANT: In the email body code block, add line breaks within paragraphs approximately every 60-70 characters to ensure readability without horizontal scrolling. The email will still render correctly when copied and pasted.

Output only these two code blocks with no additional text or formatting.
